### Hey there, I'm Kai!

I'm a 17 year old maker from Canada hacking on PCB's and building hardware!

I've done a lot of cool things like:
- Ran a popup cafe in China with other hackers
- Ran my own hackathon with the goal of building the dumbest thing possible
- Went on an 8-day cross-country train hackathon across Canada
- Attended one of the largest hardware hackathons for highschoolers in SF
- And so much more!

### The website

This website's made in Svelte, I usually work with NextJS so it was a nice switchup and I'm really liking it.

You can setup the project using:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
