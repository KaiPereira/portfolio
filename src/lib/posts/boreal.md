# All aboard the Boreal Express

In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to attend one of the coolest hackathons that's ever happened, the [Boreal Express](https://boreal.hackclub.com/)...

Now this wasn't any ordinary hackathon, this was a cross-country journey on a train, where you got to meet some of the coolest highschool hackers from around the world and build projects without any wifi, just the help of others.

But let's back up a little bit to how I actually got invited... 

A couple months before Boreal was going to happen, I was perusing the internet for fun hackathons in Vancouver where I could meet others nearby, and came across a cross-country hackathon on a train. I did not believe this could be real, an all-expenses paid 8-day expedition from Vancouver to Montreal for only highschoolers put on by this amazing organization called [Hackclub](https://hackclub.com/).

Hackclub runs some of the coolest events for high schoolers like [Apocalypse](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/), a zombie themed hackathon in Toronto, to events like Arcade, where you work on projects and redeem hours for free stuff like hardware.

The Boreal Express was an invite-only hackathon, you had to submit projects to get accepted, similar to Hack the North and other hackathons, but on a smaller scale. Now around this time, I hadn't actually have made too many projects aside from some small apps and stuff that never really got anywhere, but I did have this one hackathon project I build for a 12h local hackathon that got #1 so it was really my one shot at getting an invite to the Boreal Express...

I wasn't too proud of this project, but it was kind of a neat concept around helping to prevent school shootings, so I submitted it and hoped for the best!

A couple weeks later, I don't actually here anything aside from other people getting rejected, but then a couple weeks before the Boreal Express was going to happen, I got an acceptance letter, I was in for one of the coolest experiences of my life :D

Fast-forward a couple of weeks, I get my flights booked with the organizers, and I take a ferry over with my family to Vancouver and I'm off on my way to Boreal Express.

The entire group was set to meet on Jericho beach at sunset, and I got to meet lots of cool people like [Angad](https://angad.me/) who I was feeding the bunnies with, Advay (my roomate) and a bunch of other really interesting hackers!

I was pretty shy because this was one of my very first events I'd been too and I was all alone, but after a bit of awkwardness I started to talk to a bunch of people about some common passions and learnt a bunch of cool stuff about radio's, docker and other things. 

Learning from this experience, I think it's incredibly important to just have deep conversations with people. You learn such an insane amount and form incredibly strong connections with those people, I wish I talked a bit more to others but I still learned a lot nonetheless.

After the sunset, we fooled around on the beach, had some Poke, tried to set off some fireworks (but the police were faster), and all huddled around to finish the night off with our own [Boreal song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKQDGMpJNws) from [Woody and his group](https://woodykeppel.com/) (you'll hear more about them soon, they're very interesting people). 

We met back at a little hostel right by the beach, and then chatted about until we couldn't stay awake anymore. Something I took away from this was that sleep actually comes last during events like these, you miss a lot of interesting stuff when you sleep, and it's kind of that time where you form deep connections with people.

On day 2, we ate some breakfast and hopped on a bus to get to the VIA rail headquarters. It was this really cool old-fashioned style building and we got a bunch of swag and stickers as soon as we arrived.

After arriving, the organizers held the opening ceremony where we got to hear some talks from ministers, the VIA rail higher-ups and of course from the organizers Deven, Zach, Christina and others. 

Most of the people had arrived for the hackathon by now, so there were LOTS more people and the room was nearly packed! There were hackers from Greece, Australia, the US, germany, literally EVERYWHERE, it was really amazing!

We then went out to science world for lunch, where we had kind of like an information presentation for the train, and then we all fooled around at the playground, must've been very interesting seeing 50 kids all with yellow buffs with "hackclub" on them running around a playground!

We then headed back to the VIA rail station to begin our journey... We all hopped into a group photo, and then we made our way to our train and finally departed. Looking back it all seems like a blur, but it was a really exciting and pivotal moment in my life.

On board, we were presented with our rooms, and then toured around the train a bit to get used to the different rooms, and then the train left on it's merry way. We had the entire front of the train and the back still had like normal passengers and stuff, but we had access to like the sunroofs, and the cool transparent carriage at the front!
