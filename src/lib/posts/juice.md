# Running a Hacker Cafe in China

February of 2025, I was presented with the opportunity of a lifetime.

An organization called Hackclub was running an event where if you spent 100 hours building a game, you would get an all expenses paid, week-long trip to Shanghai, China to present your games in a hacker cafe and meet some of the coolest hackers on the planet!

It was an irrefutable opportunity, I had just gotten back from my adventures aboard the [Boreal Express](https://kaipereira.com/journal/boreal), and I was looking for the next big thing in my life, it was perfect!

The next couple months of my life were pretty gruesome, you had 2 months to complete 100 hours, so you had to spend over 2 hours a day working on your game, not impossible, but still pretty difficult.

The premise of my game was simple... I combined my 2 favorite things, bubble tea and cats, in order to create a restaurant style game like Papa's Pizzeria where you would serve customers, build up your restaurant and dominate the bubble tea market!

The game turned out decently, not my most proud project to be honest though but I had hit my 100 hours just by the end of the second month, had my ticket booked and was off to China!!!

In order to travel to China, you need to have a Visa and a letter of invitation. I got a letter of invitation from the organizers of the event, and then went to Vancouver for a couple days in order to get my Visa processed! I took a little side-quest in Whistler to do some skiing which was nice and then came back home to finish working on my game!

I left for my flight on the third of April. The flight... was evil, I was flying from Victoria (my home town in Canada!) to Vancouver, and then Vancouver to Shanghai, not too many connections but nearly 14 hours of flying straight.

I'm a pretty accustomed traveler, I've been fortunate enough to travel to many places like Africa, Europe, South America, but it was my first time in Asia, and this was probably the longest flight I've ever had continuously!

My flight from Victoria to Vancouver was just around 30 minutes, really short, and simple. I arrived in Vancouver without any problems, and then it was time to hop on my flight to Shanghai! There were about 100 people from around the world attending to Juice, so when I arrived at the gate for my flight to shanghai and saw 5 of them, I was pleasantly surprised and actually knew a couple from online.

Everyone was so nice, and it was really easy to talk to other like-minded people who went through the exact same process of building a game in two months. I was still really nervous to be going to an unknown country with a completely different culture though, but having these friends around me, helped a lot!

And just like that, we were off on our way to Shanghai...

Arriving in the Shanghai airport, I wasn't really stressed, but a bit nervous. We had come to realize that absolutely NO ONE spoke English in the airport which surprised me a LOT and every single sign was written in characters absolutely foreign to us. We did have one person in our group though who could speak and understand the language, so they helped to guide us through the process of getting through the airport!

The first thing we needed to do was go to the self-help kiosk, get our bio-metrics/passport scanned and then you'll get a receipt you need to keep.

We then made our way to the border inspector who took a look at our documents and then let us get on with our journey. It was a bit intimidating because we couldn't speak the same language, so the only way they could communicate with us, was through actions, and grunts. 

Something you'll quickly notice is that the wifi is non-existential, and that you need to be prepared with a backup plan and have some VPN's. I used surfshark on my phone and had a little device that gave me internet if I needed it, so it was going to be really important to have this on me at all times!

Tongyu, one of the event organizers was waiting for the latest group of kids to come at a Starbucks in the mall. It gave me the opportunity to admire the cool culture and to talk with some of the people. I thought that the fashion in China was pretty cool, everyone had their own style and was completely different from Canada! Everyone I talked to was really nice, and we could all talk for hours about nerdy stuff like programming, games, books, etc.

After a bit, our group went outside to take an Uber to the first hotel of the trip! As soon as my face touched the fresh breeze, I couldn't help but notice the distinct smell of cigarettes in the air. China's a beautiful place, but it definitely has some pollution, but you get used to it really fast!

It was kind of a cloudy day, and I hopped into an Uber with some of the friends I had met, and we were off to the first hotel! 

Travelling along the highway, you'll instantly notice how contrasting everything is. We started off driving literally above the entire city, with a view for as long as the eye can see, for nearly 30 minutes. Then, you'll see like 20 huge skyscrapers all absolutely identical in the distance but tiny houses outlining them, and then a huge bridge just actively being built over top of the world, it was really interesting to say the least.

After a little while of driving, you'll get more into the heart of the city, all the skyscrapers just booming above you, you're a speck of dust in an ever expansive forest of buildings. This city was unimaginably large, you could NEVER see the edge of it. It felt dystopian at times, unreal in others.

You also had this deep down feeling that you were the only person in the world here. All the locals felt like they were just minding their own day, and I didn't really catch too much attention as a foreigner which really surprised me!

We were all extremely exhausted when we got to the hotel, and we got to meet some of the other organizers like Kai Ling and Thomas, who were definitely stressed to say the least. They had to setup nearly 150 people in hotels and sort out all of their issues.

We had to hand out our passports to the hotel employee's so they could verify our identity, and then while they were processing everything, I setup my computer to start a little programming circle! I was working on one of my first PCB's at the time, it was a little keyboard, so I got a bit of time in working on that, and lots of people were interested in it because not too many highschoolers are working on circuit boards!

After having some nice chats with some people, we got our passports back and I made my way to my room who I was actually sharing with my sister, who also did the 100 hours, and who was going to be travelling with me!

We just stored our luggage down, and then made our way back to the lobby where everyone was assembling to go to supper! We walked for about 30 minutes until we arrived at this really cute restaurant with 10 circular white tables setup, each sitting about 10 other people, to accommodate all 100 of us!

I was sitting at the table with my sister and a couple people I had met, alongside Thomas! It was great to chat with everyone, and I grew closer with a friend named Lopa from Egypt who was a nice guy to be around!

We were just served endless amounts of dishes in a style I've never experienced before. The tables would essentially spin, and the employee's would just keep on adding dishes to the table, and we would spin it around so that everyone could try a bit of everything. When you were done, you would put the dish into the middle of the table!

Now one important thing when using chopsticks in China is DON'T PUT THEM UPRIGHT in your bowl, this is just considered rude, so just place them on the side of your bowl or at rest.

Another thing that was kind of problematic for me was that I had many allergies, specifically gluten, dairy and eggs, so knowing what I could and couldn't eat was going to be very difficult! Although I wouldn't die if I had some, I wouldn't feel the best.

Luckily, some of the organizers could speak mandarin, unluckily was that I couldn't actually eat much, so I kind of just lived off of the few dishes I could have.

The food was really interesting, you had no clue what you were actually eating, just that it tasted good, and different. For example, we got served these noodles that were like transparent and green, but they were like actually a vegetable that tasted like noodles? There were also these egg dishes that just completely did not resemble eggs, it was really interesting!

We actually had found ourselves at a vegan table, even though we weren't vegan which was a bit confusing, because only realized like an hour into dinner that there wasn't meat because all the dishes were so unique. After dinner, we all settled and then headed back to the hotel to get a good nights sleep.

Now this is going to be the only restful sleep that we get for the entire week, the next days are going to be filled with days of absolutely no rest, and minor sleep. There was little time to experience a gigantic world like this so we wanted to make the most of it!

We woke up, got ready to go downstairs and had a nice breakfast with some of our new friends! It was buffet style, and had plenty of options, not too many I could have, but I could make do by eating fruit, and some of the meat dishes too. I had also brought some emergency peanut butter just in case I couldn't eat anything, but I was fine except for on a couple occasions!

Today, our plan was to have opening ceremony at the Bottle Dream venue, where we'd be serving Juice to some of the locals and showcasing our games! So right after breakfast, we made our way through the twisty turny alleys of Shanghai, until we reached the spot!

I was really surprised by the temperature and climate around mid-day or so. It was really hot and humid, even though it was April, which was a change from Victoria, which was pretty cold around the same time. I think we went during like a heat wave though because it was like extra hot around this time, maybe about 30 - 35 degree's celsius!

It was always so nice to chat to people during this trip, I probably had the most deep conversations of any event I've been too throughout this, and I'll detail some of my more specific conversations a bit later in this story.

Bottle Dream was such a cool venue, it was like a modern wood building, and you'd take these little steps to get up to it. It felt like it's own little world! We signed and drew on the welcoming whiteboard, and then sat down in our little chairs, anticipating the opening ceremony.

I had actually brought a polaroid camera, so once everyone had flooded in, I took a large group photo with everyone, which turned out great!!!

The opening ceremony was hype, the mood was positive, the vibes were on point, and everyone was excited for what was to come. We got a quick rundown of the do's and don't inside of Bottle Dream, and then we got to choose teams and get some merch!

The teams were simple, everyone in that group would be like working on stuff related to a common subject:
- Tongyu: Game music and sound, so just like making general vibes
- Kai Ling: I think was art, and making the venue look nice
- Thomas: Web stuff, so like creating cool websites about the games and whatnot
- Acon: Hardware, pcb's, all that fun stuff

Now I might have some of these the wrong order, but these were the general categories!

I ended up choosing Acon's team, because I was really interested in getting into hardware at this point, and she knew a lot about building fun hardware!

We also received a bunch of merch right after opening ceremony! This was a TON of really cool stuff like varsity jackets, laptop bags, stickers, like figdets, a bunch of really cool stuff ALL DESIGNED by HIGHSCHOOLERS!!

After we received all the goods, and chose our teams, we messed around a bit with making some Juice and then went out to get some lunch!

We walked over to a mall, where half of us split up to go to a KFC (or maybe it was a burger kind, I can't really remember), and the other half to go to a little vegan place (because we had quite a few people with allergies).

I kid you not, this was the best vegan food I've ever had in my life. I got this spicy tofu dish that was like half a kilo of soft, luscious tofu, alongside some tomato soup, and edamame, it was AMAZING! They also had this really good tea-based drink, that tasted like a mix of strawberry and raspberry that was soooooo good!!!!

We were allowed to spend $5 USD/person per meal, and with this amount, we could still get a TON, food was so cheap and so good in China!

After lunch, we made our way back to the venue to chill and showcase some of our games to each other. We fooled around a bit with making juice, and I played a lot of cool games from some other people! I played [Ossatura](https://jadenlong1234.itch.io/ossatura-demo) one of my favorite games by Adrian and Siwen, 2 really nice people I met in China!

We also had a little meetup with our team about what we wanted to make, and to see if we could get working/manufacturing some PCB's while in the heart of the hardware world!

And just like that, we were nearing the end of day 2, so we went out to get some dinner (I don't really remember where exactly at, but it was probably something good).

Now before I went to sleep, I needed to try the bubble tea... We conveniently had this bubble tea place right by our hotel, so I popped over with my sister and some friends!

Now paying for stuff is pretty convenient in China! You can usually do everything through Alipay, you just scan the businesses QR code, pick what you want, and just order everything through the app, you can even translate all the Chinese to English!

I kid you not, this is also the best bubble I've ever and will ever have in my life. I'm telling you they juice the fruit right in front of you, the pearls are fresh as can be, and the serving sizes are huge. Best part is, it costs less than $2 for an absolutely huge drink!!! Unbelievable.

So I walk back with my friends and we chill in the lobby, I'm kind of vibing while working on some PCB's with others working on their games, being in China really felt peaceful, even though you were in one of the largest cities on earth.

I woke up on day 3 with a nice sunrise, and made my way out for breakfast. I saw [Zach](https://zachlatta.com/), the founder of Hackclub along the way, this was my second time meeting him, the first being on the Boreal Express, and it's just so cool when you unexpectedly meet people you saw on the other side of the world!

We had to wake up a bit earlier today, because each group was going to get out and do some different activities. Our group decided to go out to this huge strip mall called Nanjing Road!

We took a 20 minute railroad journey to get to the shopping street, and as soon as I got out, I couldn't help but feel like an ant in a city of giants. This was one of the most expansive malls I've ever seen in my life, hundreds of towering buildings caved around this huge pavilion.

We were allotted about an hour to explore the area, and my friend needed to fix his phone, so we went to an Apple store! While my friend was getting some help, me and another friend went to get a drink, because it was absolutely beaming outside, probably around 35 degree's celsius!

I have a lot of allergies, so it was kind of hard to choose what I wanted to drink, and the language barrier made it impossible to communicate, so I just ended up pointing to a drink that said herbal.

This place looked really good, it was sweet and modern, and all the photo's looked really amazing, but I was still shocked when I received the most gorgeous drink of my life.

I can only describe it as a swirl of herbal tea's, with floating strawberry's and other sweet fruits, freezing cold on a boiling hot day! The food in china is honestly just unmatched and amazing!!

And we didn't realize it, but we had actually just stepped foot into a giant mall. A giant mall, literally on the outskirts of the largest plaza I've ever seen, the scenery around you just changes so fast in China.

So we went exploring a bit in the mall, and this place was honestly kind of huge, larger than any mall I've ever seen in Victoria, but it was also like completely empty, except for the occasional passerby or two. We explored all the different stages, and everything just morphed around us so fast, we went from a Nike store, to a little local food place, to a huge Michelin star restaurant built into a wall. it was very interesting to say the least, but a common occurrence here!

Time passed by pretty fast though and so we headed back to the center of the plaza where our group was waiting. Once we got everyone together, we decided to go check out a little comic-con that was happening on that day! I don't think any of us intentionally planned on visiting it, but it was really cool and some people bought some collectibles from the shop.

There were huge models of mechs, really cool cosplay, and of course, many anime posters throughout the entire thing! I honestly kind of wish I brought something home from it, but it was really cool to see and everyone seemed really passionate about their stuff there!

Anyways, we had spent a couple of hours exploring around, and all of us were getting pretty hungry, so it was time to go grab some lunch. We decided to go to a KFC, because it was close and cheap, but I couldn't actually eat a single thing on the KFC menu, so I was going to have to tolerate my hunger for a bit longer until I could get back to the hotel and use my backup supply of PB and J.

I had a really nice conversation with one of the kids about the inner workings of planes/helicopters! You learn so much from other people just by listening and asking basic questions, and there are so many people smarter than you... having these deep conversations are one of my favorite things about adventures like this. You learn so much, and it opens up so many oppurtunities and pathways in your head!
