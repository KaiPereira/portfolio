# Running a Hacker Cafe in China

February of 2025, I was presented with the opportunity of a lifetime.

An organization called Hackclub was running an event where if you spent 100 hours building a game, you would get an all expenses paid trip to Shanghai, China to present your games in a hacker cafe and meet some of the coolest hackers on the planet!

It was an irrefutable opportunity, I had just gotten back from my adventures aboard the [Boreal Express](https://kaipereira.com/journal/boreal), and I was looking for the next big thing in my life, it was perfect!

The next couple months of my life were pretty gruesome, you had 2 months to complete 100 hours, so you had to spend over 2 hours a day working on your game, not impossible, but still pretty difficult.

The premise of my game was simple... I combined my 2 favorite things, bubble tea and cats, in order to create a restaurant style game like Papa's Pizzeria where you would serve customers, build up your restaurant and dominate the bubble tea market!

The game turned out decently, not my most proud project to be honest though but I had hit my 100 hours just by the end of the second month, had my ticket booked and was off to China!!!

I left off for my flight on the third of April. The flight... was evil, I was flying from Victoria (my home town in Canada!) to Vancouver, and then Vancouver to Shanghai, not too many connections but nearly 14 hours of flying straight.

I'm a pretty accustomed traveler, I've been fortunate enough to travel to many places like Africa, Europe, South America, but it was my first time in Asia, and this was probably the longest flight I've ever had continuously!

My flight from Victoria to Vancouver was just around 30 minutes, really short, and simple. I arrived in Vancouver without any problems, and then it was time to hop on my flight to Shanghai! There were about 100 people from around the world attending to Juice, so when I arrived at the gate for my flight to shanghai and saw 5 of them, I was pleasantly surprised and actually knew a couple from online.

Everyone was so nice, and it was really easy to talk to other like-minded people who went through the exact same process of building a game in two months. I was still really nervous to be going to an unknown country with a completely different culture though, but having these friends around me, helped a lot!

And just like that, we were off on our way to Shanghai...
