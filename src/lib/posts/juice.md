# Running a Hacker Cafe in China

February of 2025, I was presented with the opportunity of a lifetime.

An organization called Hackclub was running an event where if you spent 100 hours building a game, you would get an all expenses paid, week-long trip to Shanghai, China to present your games in a hacker cafe and meet some of the coolest hackers on the planet!

It was an irrefutable opportunity, I had just gotten back from my adventures aboard the [Boreal Express](https://kaipereira.com/journal/boreal), and I was looking for the next big thing in my life, it was perfect!

The next couple months of my life were pretty gruesome, you had 2 months to complete 100 hours, so you had to spend over 2 hours a day working on your game, not impossible, but still pretty difficult.

The premise of my game was simple... I combined my 2 favorite things, bubble tea and cats, in order to create a restaurant style game like Papa's Pizzeria where you would serve customers, build up your restaurant and dominate the bubble tea market!

The game turned out decently, not my most proud project to be honest though but I had hit my 100 hours just by the end of the second month, had my ticket booked and was off to China!!!

In order to travel to China, you need to have a Visa and a letter of invitation. I got a letter of invitation from the organizers of the event, and then went to Vancouver for a couple days in order to get my Visa processed! I took a little side-quest in Whistler to do some skiing which was nice and then came back home to finish working on my game!

I left for my flight on the third of April. The flight... was evil, I was flying from Victoria (my home town in Canada!) to Vancouver, and then Vancouver to Shanghai, not too many connections but nearly 14 hours of flying straight.

I'm a pretty accustomed traveler, I've been fortunate enough to travel to many places like Africa, Europe, South America, but it was my first time in Asia, and this was probably the longest flight I've ever had continuously!

My flight from Victoria to Vancouver was just around 30 minutes, really short, and simple. I arrived in Vancouver without any problems, and then it was time to hop on my flight to Shanghai! There were about 100 people from around the world attending to Juice, so when I arrived at the gate for my flight to shanghai and saw 5 of them, I was pleasantly surprised and actually knew a couple from online.

Everyone was so nice, and it was really easy to talk to other like-minded people who went through the exact same process of building a game in two months. I was still really nervous to be going to an unknown country with a completely different culture though, but having these friends around me, helped a lot!

And just like that, we were off on our way to Shanghai...

Arriving in the Shanghai airport, I wasn't really stressed, but a bit nervous. We had come to realize that absolutely NO ONE spoke English in the airport which surprised me a LOT and every single sign was written in characters absolutely foreign to us. We did have one person in our group though who could speak and understand the language, so they helped to guide us through the process of getting through the airport!

The first thing we needed to do was go to the self-help kiosk, get our bio-metrics/passport scanned and then you'll get a receipt you need to keep.

We then made our way to the border inspector who took a look at our documents and then let us get on with our journey. It was a bit intimidating because we couldn't speak the same language, so the only way they could communicate with us, was through actions, and grunts. 

Something you'll quickly notice is that the wifi is non-existential, and that you need to be prepared with a backup plan and have some VPN's. I used surfshark on my phone and had a little device that gave me internet if I needed it, so it was going to be really important to have this on me at all times! Another thing is that Google is completely restricted in China, you are not going to be able to use Google services, so don't rely on Google Translate or Chrome.

Tongyu, one of the event organizers was waiting for the latest group of kids to come at a Starbucks in the mall. It gave me the opportunity to admire the cool culture and to talk with some of the people. I thought that the fashion in China was pretty cool, everyone had their own style and was completely different from Canada! Everyone I talked to was really nice, and we could all talk for hours about nerdy stuff like programming, games, books, etc.

After a bit, our group went outside to take a DiDi to the first hotel of the trip! DiDi is essentially the replacement for Uber in Shanghai, and it's super easy to use because it's implemented into Alipay!

As soon as my face touched the fresh breeze, I couldn't help but notice the distinct smell of cigarettes in the air. China's a beautiful place, but it definitely has some pollution, but you get used to it really fast!

It was kind of a cloudy day, and I hopped into an Uber with some of the friends I had met, and we were off to the first hotel! 

Travelling along the highway, you'll instantly notice how contrasting everything is. We started off driving literally above the entire city, with a view for as long as the eye can see, for nearly 30 minutes. Then, you'll see like 20 huge skyscrapers all absolutely identical in the distance but tiny houses outlining them, and then a huge bridge just actively being built over top of the world, it was really interesting to say the least.

After a little while of driving, you'll get more into the heart of the city, all the skyscrapers just booming above you, you're a speck of dust in an ever expansive forest of buildings. This city was unimaginably large, you could NEVER see the edge of it. It felt dystopian at times, unreal in others.

You also had this deep down feeling that you were the only person in the world here. All the locals felt like they were just minding their own day, and I didn't really catch too much attention as a foreigner which really surprised me!

We were all extremely exhausted when we got to the hotel, and we got to meet some of the other organizers like Kai Ling and Thomas, who were definitely stressed to say the least. They had to setup nearly 150 people in hotels and sort out all of their issues.

We had to hand out our passports to the hotel employee's so they could verify our identity, and then while they were processing everything, I setup my computer to start a little programming circle! I was working on one of my first PCB's at the time, it was a little keyboard, so I got a bit of time in working on that, and lots of people were interested in it because not too many highschoolers are working on circuit boards!

After having some nice chats with some people, we got our passports back and I made my way to my room who I was actually sharing with my sister, who also did the 100 hours, and who was going to be travelling with me!

We just stored our luggage down, and then made our way back to the lobby where everyone was assembling to go to supper! We walked for about 30 minutes until we arrived at this really cute restaurant with 10 circular white tables setup, each sitting about 10 other people, to accommodate all 100 of us!

I was sitting at the table with my sister and a couple people I had met, alongside Thomas! It was great to chat with everyone, and I grew closer with a friend named Lopa from Egypt who was a nice guy to be around!

We were just served endless amounts of dishes in a style I've never experienced before. The tables would essentially spin, and the employee's would just keep on adding dishes to the table, and we would spin it around so that everyone could try a bit of everything. When you were done, you would put the dish into the middle of the table!

Now one important thing when using chopsticks in China is DON'T PUT THEM UPRIGHT in your bowl, this is just considered rude, so just place them on the side of your bowl or at rest.

Another thing that was kind of problematic for me was that I had many allergies, specifically gluten, dairy and eggs, so knowing what I could and couldn't eat was going to be very difficult! Although I wouldn't die if I had some, I wouldn't feel the best.

Luckily, some of the organizers could speak mandarin, unluckily was that I couldn't actually eat much, so I kind of just lived off of the few dishes I could have.

The food was really interesting, you had no clue what you were actually eating, just that it tasted good, and different. For example, we got served these noodles that were like transparent and green, but they were like actually a vegetable that tasted like noodles? There were also these egg dishes that just completely did not resemble eggs, it was really interesting!

We actually had found ourselves at a vegan table, even though we weren't vegan which was a bit confusing, because only realized like an hour into dinner that there wasn't meat because all the dishes were so unique. After dinner, we all settled and then headed back to the hotel to get a good nights sleep.

Now this is going to be the only restful sleep that we get for the entire week, the next days are going to be filled with days of absolutely no rest, and minor sleep. There was little time to experience a gigantic world like this so we wanted to make the most of it!

We woke up, got ready to go downstairs and had a nice breakfast with some of our new friends! It was buffet style, and had plenty of options, not too many I could have, but I could make do by eating fruit, and some of the meat dishes too. I had also brought some emergency peanut butter just in case I couldn't eat anything, but I was fine except for on a couple occasions!

Today, our plan was to have opening ceremony at the Bottle Dream venue, where we'd be serving Juice to some of the locals and showcasing our games! So right after breakfast, we made our way through the twisty turny alleys of Shanghai, until we reached the spot!

I was really surprised by the temperature and climate around mid-day or so. It was really hot and humid, even though it was April, which was a change from Victoria, which was pretty cold around the same time. I think we went during like a heat wave though because it was like extra hot around this time, maybe about 30 - 35 degree's celsius!

It was always so nice to chat to people during this trip, I probably had the most deep conversations of any event I've been too throughout this, and I'll detail some of my more specific conversations a bit later in this story.

Bottle Dream was such a cool venue, it was like a modern wood building, and you'd take these little steps to get up to it. It felt like it's own little world! We signed and drew on the welcoming whiteboard, and then sat down in our little chairs, anticipating the opening ceremony.

I had actually brought a polaroid camera, so once everyone had flooded in, I took a large group photo with everyone, which turned out great!!!

The opening ceremony was hype, the mood was positive, the vibes were on point, and everyone was excited for what was to come. We got a quick rundown of the do's and don't inside of Bottle Dream, and then we got to choose teams and get some merch!

The teams were simple, everyone in that group would be like working on stuff related to a common subject:
- Tongyu: Game music and sound, so just like making general vibes
- Kai Ling: I think was art, and making the venue look nice
- Thomas: Web stuff, so like creating cool websites about the games and whatnot
- Acon: Hardware, pcb's, all that fun stuff

Now I might have some of these the wrong order, but these were the general categories!

I ended up choosing Acon's team, because I was really interested in getting into hardware at this point, and she knew a lot about building fun hardware!

We also received a bunch of merch right after opening ceremony! This was a TON of really cool stuff like varsity jackets, laptop bags, stickers, like figdets, a bunch of really cool stuff ALL DESIGNED by HIGHSCHOOLERS!!

After we received all the goods, and chose our teams, we messed around a bit with making some Juice and then went out to get some lunch!

We walked over to a mall, where half of us split up to go to a KFC (or maybe it was a burger kind, I can't really remember), and the other half to go to a little vegan place (because we had quite a few people with allergies).

I kid you not, this was the best vegan food I've ever had in my life. I got this spicy tofu dish that was like half a kilo of soft, luscious tofu, alongside some tomato soup, and edamame, it was AMAZING! They also had this really good tea-based drink, that tasted like a mix of strawberry and raspberry that was soooooo good!!!!

We were allowed to spend $5 USD/person per meal, and with this amount, we could still get a TON, food was so cheap and so good in China!

After lunch, we made our way back to the venue to chill and showcase some of our games to each other. We fooled around a bit with making juice, and I played a lot of cool games from some other people! I played [Ossatura](https://jadenlong1234.itch.io/ossatura-demo) one of my favorite games by Adrian and Siwen, 2 really nice people I met in China!

We also had a little meetup with our team about what we wanted to make, and to see if we could get working/manufacturing some PCB's while in the heart of the hardware world!

And just like that, we were nearing the end of day 2, so we went out to get some dinner (I don't really remember where exactly at, but it was probably something good).

Now before I went to sleep, I needed to try the bubble tea... We conveniently had this bubble tea place right by our hotel, so I popped over with my sister and some friends!

Now paying for stuff is pretty convenient in China! You can usually do everything through Alipay, you just scan the businesses QR code, pick what you want, and just order everything through the app, you can even translate all the Chinese to English!

I kid you not, this is also the best bubble I've ever and will ever have in my life. I'm telling you they juice the fruit right in front of you, the pearls are fresh as can be, and the serving sizes are huge. Best part is, it costs less than $2 for an absolutely huge drink!!! Unbelievable.

So I walk back with my friends and we chill in the lobby, I'm kind of vibing while working on some PCB's with others working on their games, being in China really felt peaceful, even though you were in one of the largest cities on earth.

Now before I went to sleep, I needed to charge my devices! Now this was something I was prepared for, but haven't really experiences. The plugs are just like completely different, so you need to have an adapter for everything. Also the plugs aren't like properly grounded, so like the metal chassis on my laptop would like crackle a bit when you touched it, it was very interesting...

I woke up on day 3 with a beautiful sunrise, and made my way out for breakfast. I saw [Zach](https://zachlatta.com/), the founder of Hackclub along the way, this was my second time meeting him, the first being on the Boreal Express, and it's just so cool when you unexpectedly meet people you saw on the other side of the world! He's one of the most interesting, down-to-earth people you'd ever meet, so we had a little chat and then parted ways because he was definitely a bit tired.

We had to wake up a bit earlier today, because each group was going to get out and do some different activities. Our group decided to go out to this huge strip mall called Nanjing Road!

We took a 20 minute railroad journey to get to the shopping street, and as soon as I got out, I couldn't help but feel like an ant in a city of giants. This was one of the most expansive malls I've ever seen in my life, hundreds of towering buildings caved around this huge pavilion.

We were allotted about an hour to explore the area, and my friend needed to fix his phone, so we went to an Apple store! While my friend was getting some help, me and another friend went to get a drink, because it was absolutely beaming outside, probably around 35 degree's celsius!

I have a lot of allergies, so it was kind of hard to choose what I wanted to drink, and the language barrier made it impossible to communicate, so I just ended up pointing to a drink that said herbal.

This place looked really good, it was sweet and modern, and all the photo's looked really amazing, but I was still shocked when I received the most gorgeous drink of my life.

I can only describe it as a swirl of herbal tea's, with floating strawberry's and other sweet fruits, freezing cold on a boiling hot day! The food in china is honestly just unmatched and amazing!!

And we didn't realize it, but we had actually just stepped foot into a giant mall. A giant mall, literally on the outskirts of the largest plaza I've ever seen, the scenery around you just changes so fast in China.

So we went exploring a bit in the mall, and this place was honestly kind of huge, larger than any mall I've ever seen in Victoria, but it was also like completely empty, except for the occasional passerby or two. We explored all the different stages, and everything just morphed around us so fast, we went from a Nike store, to a little local food place, to a huge Michelin star restaurant built into a wall. it was very interesting to say the least, but a common occurrence here!

Time passed by pretty fast though and so we headed back to the center of the plaza where our group was waiting. Once we got everyone together, we decided to go check out a little comic-con that was happening on that day! I don't think any of us intentionally planned on visiting it, but it was really cool and some people bought some collectibles from the shop.

There were huge models of mechs, really cool cosplay, and of course, many anime posters throughout the entire thing! The entire building somehow felt like a video game in itself. I honestly kind of wish I brought something home from it, but it was really cool to see and everyone seemed really passionate about their stuff there!

Anyways, we had spent a couple of hours exploring around, and all of us were getting pretty hungry, so it was time to go grab some lunch. We decided to go to a KFC, because it was close and cheap, but I couldn't actually eat a single thing on the KFC menu, so I was going to have to tolerate my hunger for a bit longer until I could get back to the hotel and use my backup supply of PB and J.

I had a really nice conversation with one of the kids about the inner workings of planes/helicopters! My favorite thing about cool events like this is to just listen to the experiences of other people. You just learn so much, and it opens up to many opportunities to do different things and find what you love to do! I might've honestly never worked on hardware, and would've stuck with software if it weren't for some of these experiences!

Everyone was wrapping up, so we hopped back onto the train, and made our way back to the hotel! Half of us split up, to go to Bottle Dream, and the other half went back to the hotel to get away from the sun for a bit, and I could finally quench my hunger.

Now you'd probably think that with all these adventures that no one was running the cafe in-between, but in reality the groups would just kind of take turns running it, while other groups went out to do stuff! So now it was our time to run the Cafe!

I decided to sidequest a bit on making a doorbell for the venue, because I was on the hardware team, and I also wanted to check out some games from others. I played this really cool hiking game, where you had to navigate your way through terrain with a compass, which was insanely hard, but you could also play it in VR which was absolutely insane. One of my favorite games for sure!

We had quite a few people come into the Cafe too, so we gave them some Juice, and then we got them to play our games a bit, the kids really enjoyed it! We had these massive signs near the entrance to the venue because we were a bit higher up, so it was our main way of attracting people, and we could take turns advertising.

In the span of a couple hour, it was already getting dark though, so we waited for another group to cover us and then we went out for dinner! We went to this little place that was in the same alley as our venue, and it was like straight out of the movies...

Mahjong being played in the back, smell of tea in the air, it felt like I was in a movie. But sadly, I couldn't actually eat a thing in the restaurant, and the language barrier was like really difficult, so I literally just ate a bowl of rice while I waited to get back to the hotel. While the food is so good in China, it's not the best place for gluten free, and other allergies...

Everyone was really hungry so we finished up pretty fast, and then headed back to the hotel, where I picked up some bubble tea with some friends along the way. Now this bubble tea was legitimately a full meal so I didn't really feel the need to eat much more afterwards. My classic was to get this passion-fruit, orange combo, that had a bunch of fruit pieces inside, it was soooo good!!!

Now the next day we were going to change things up a bit, we were going to move venue's from Bottle Dream to Spark Labs, which was a lot farther away, so we actually needed to move hotels.

This meant we were going to have to get up a bit earlier to catch an Uber to the next venue. But instead of getting up early, we got up to some mischief and just messed around all night pretty much... This is one of my favorite parts about cool events, just not sleeping and hanging out with the friends you've made, and I honestly wish that I had done it more.

We started just renting out the bikes that lined the streets in the thousands, and taught 2 of my friends how to ride bikes for the first time! And then we went back to the room to do some karaoke and play around with this silly AI assistant similar to a Google Home mini inside of the rooms. It was a really fun night and some of us just didn't get any sleep that night, but I managed to punch out a couple hours! 

This experience really helped to fully break my mindset about just doing what feels right, and if you want to pull an all-nighter just do it. It's fine to be a bit irresponsible sometimes, and everything finds a way of working out.

After getting a bit of sleep though, we woke up to the sunrise, packed our bags, and headed down for some breakfast. You don't really feel that tired when you're in scenario's, but like you actually are, so it'll hit you really hard at some random point, and you might space out once or twice...

We had a really nice breakfast, and it was always really lovely to chat to others during these times too. Lots of these people I've seen online but haven't talked to, and they're all really interesting people, so these conversations were transformational and really fun.

After breakfast, we grouped together where the organizers were calling DiDi's for everyone, so me and my sister hopped into one to get to our next hotel! 

There's a lot of really interesting things you'll notice when taking a car in China. The first thing is the car itself. Our DiDi's were usually like really high class, they had like luxurious massage chairs, were full black and really high quality (thought I'm sure not all of them were like this). Also the majority of the cars are electric so the roads feel much more quiet even with much more people, the drivers are so smooth...

The next thing you'll notice is the roads themselves. They're huge, insanely packed, and the drivers are always really aggressive. You definitely felt like you'd get into an accident sometimes, but you got to your place on time! Some of the intersections also had like 8 roads going into one which was really cool, and way too complex for my head, but you kind of need this sort of thing with so many people.

I initially thought we were at the wrong hotel when we pulled up, because this was fancier than anything I've ever seen. A building the size of the white house, with fountains, arches, long driveways, it was insanely cool, and felt like I was pulling up to the ball!

But the inside, absolutely deserted aside from one employee at the desk alongside Thomas who was getting everyone checked in. It was a room the size of my house, with nothing but a desk and a piano in the back corner.

This was about to change as kids were starting to all roll in, so we quickly got checked in, waited for some of our friends who were also checking in and then made our way up to our rooms.

Now I didn't think this place could get any fancier... but it did of course! Real sand art literally lined the ground in the hallway on every floor, with bamboo sprouting out every couple steps. And this hallway was spacious, like 2 or 3 people with arms spread fully out could probably fit in here.

The rooms were also pretty magical, there were doorbells at the front door (yes in a hotel...), and there was a nice bathroom with a fully transparent window covered by a small shade accessible on the OUTSIDE near the shower, so you could see right through which was a bit creepy, but having the shade down, worked decently well (thought you needed lots of trust in your roommates). You also had a little window that didn't open up to a balcony, but instead a smaller, inaccessible room that was filled with like plants, which was like half the size of this one, but just unused! It was a really nice room, but had some interesting design choices to say the least...

Me and my sister then went over to our friends room, where they had set up Rocket League, so we chilled and played some games with them while waiting for all the other teens to get settled. Once everyone had settled, we were called to the lobby where we were going to head over to Spark Labs, our next venue!

The walk to Spark Labs was significantly longer than Bottle Dream. Some people decided to actually take some bikes to get there, because they just lined the streets in the hundreds, and you could simply tap the pay. A really funny experience was when our friend who was just learning to bike, accidentally crossed the ENTIRETY of an intersection, diagonally on his bike, not realizing the street rules, and got honked at in every single direction...

This area was kind of known as a high-tech area in China so everything was really modern, but it was also much hotter. I'm talking like 40 degree's, so the 20 minute walk to the venue was not that pleasant.

Spark Labs was significantly different from Bottle Dream. It was set in the middle of this high-tech park area, whilst Bottle Dream was in a little alleyway, so this venue was going to be a great location to get customers at!

I loved Spark Labs, it was this little air conditioned, circular, modern building, filled with windows letting the light in, but there wasn't too much space to setup a kitchen and whatnot (just don't tell health and food safety!), but we made it work anyways.

It was getting near to lunch time though... the organizers had decided to get Subway of all takeout for the entire group, but the problem is, I can't eat Subway, nor can vegans eat Subway so we needed to find some different food options!

We found this little strip mall on maps, so we decided to walk there on foot, and see what we could find! Now maps said was going to take like 10 minutes to get there, it felt definitely closer to like 30, and when we arrived there, the only place to get food was another Subway, and Tim Hortons... So we opted to find a different place!

Now maps was showing up that there were a bunch of food places in the middle of absolutely no where, about 15 minutes up from our location so we decided to check it out. So we walked another 15 minutes up the highway, where a bunch of construction was happening and it seemed like there was nothing here, so we double checked our maps, and just kept on walking.

Just as we thought all hope was lost, we saw an absolutely GIGANTIC hole in the literal ground beneath us, that just opened up with escalators going down to who knows what. This was our last chance the find some good food, so we just trusted going down it blindly, because is was this modern little area.

I kid you not, we descended into the largest mall on the planet... It was like 6 floors tall, with every single place imaginable, and had quite a few people bustling around, we could not believe it. We were starving and immediately found a pho and dumpling place so we split up to the two places and had some lunch. This food was sooooo delicious, and it's incredible how you can just find these hidden gems just randomly in China, and this was such a common occurrence and one of the things I love about Shanghai!

We absolutely demolished our food, and then decided to split up, because me and my sister want ed to keep exploring, while our friends wanted to head back. So we continued checking out the mall, it was insanely cool, and the largest one I've been in by far! I really wanted to get a drink, so I found this sweet looking spot, and got this mango, pomelo drink which was to DIE for.

I wish I got some photo's of these drinks, but they were absolutely gorgeous colors, and had little pieces of fruit floating around, and just tasted amazing, especially on boiling days like today. 

We had overstayed our welcome at this mall though, and really had to get back to the venue though, so we headed back! It wasn't too eventful after this, we showcased our games, fooled around, I got interviewed for a video they were making on the event, and then we headed back to the hotel!

We fooled around a bit at the hotel, and then went to sleep, anticipating a really nice final day in China.

I actually had to leave a day early, because I was going to be playing piano for the retiring Chief of the Defense staff (future kai: it did not go smoothly, and I did fumble some notes), but we weren't missing out on that much, because our flight was later in the day and the event was supposed to be wrapped up before we left for the airport!

Now we decided to absolutely make the max of our day, we weren't focused on showcasing our games at all, so we decided hop in some Didi's, ditch everything and head out to a local zoo!

Now this was the coolest zoo I've ever been to in my life! I can't believe the amount of gems that exist in Shanghai... They had all sorts of cool animals ranging from meter long salamanders, to red panda's, lions, tigers, penguins, everything you can possibly imagine of!

What was also funny was the amount of kids who were at the zoo too. I think there was some school field trip or something happening while we were here, because there were like 1000's of kids in their own lines, with supervisors, all in their little uniforms, clustered in the park. It was a pretty funny sight to behold.

So we spent a couple hours in the zoo and then headed out to our next location, a Buddhist temple!
